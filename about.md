  Hey there! Thanks for your interest! If you want to learn a bit more about my work experience, have a look below at my resume. In short, I get paid to plan, talk, negotiate deals and manage projects and don't get me wrong, thought I love all of that and being out and about, I also love to loose myself into complex problems that require building upknowledge, skills and resources from the ground.

>## My GitHub repositories and this blog
>With Covid-19 and all, I took an strong interest into passive income and the financial markets. I begun playing stock-trading with monopoly money and in no time I was hooked. These repositories and blog are part of the process that led me to learn about algorithmic trading and machine learning applied to trading and portfolio management.
